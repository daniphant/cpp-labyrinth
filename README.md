# Labyrinth

A project I did for my data structure class, written in C++ that prints out the path to the exit of a labyrinth that it reads from the "labirinto.txt" file.

I was not able to extensively test it, however, so I'm unsure how accurate it is. But it did work out with the test case handed to us as seen in the included text file.

To run the program, clone the repository and compile labirinto.cpp using your compiler of choice.
